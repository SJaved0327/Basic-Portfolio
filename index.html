		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="http://lorempixel.com/g/400/200/" width="200px" alt="image of me">
		<p>I am a young professional in the field of education management. I have been working for a Manhattan-based private tutoring company for three years now, facilitating a variety of roles from client services to inventory distribution to office management to, now, tutorial operations. I believe that the start up environment has given me the tools to enter Ed Tech with open eyes to the day-to-day needs of educators, administrators, families, and students who engage each other, as well as content, through educational resources. Both personally and professionally, I seek to interrogate issues of access in the field of education. In my mind, there is no better tool to bridge access gaps than Ed Tech because of its far-reaching capabilities and ability to customize user experience.</p>
		<p>I graduated from Tufts University in 2014 (BS in Child Development and Art History) and am based in Jersey City, NJ. You can find me practicing my coding skills against the white noise of Chopped re-runs. </p>
